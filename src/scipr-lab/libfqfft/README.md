These files are extracted from ___libfqfft___, a C++ library for __Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs)__ in __finite fields__ with __multithreading__ support (via OpenMP). The library has been developed by [SCIPR Lab]. Please refer to their [repository](https://github.com/scipr-lab/libfqfft) for more details on the library.
