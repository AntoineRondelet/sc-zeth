# Result of the "trusted setup"

This folder is the target to store:

- The proving key
- The verification key

**Note:** You can change the location where the result of the setup is stored, by editing the file `../setup_env.sh`

----------------

For now the trusted setup is ran by a single, trusted, entity.
A more advanced piece of software would look into MPC to generate the CRS.
